#### We extend previous work which defined a relation on the set of Dyck paths by defining a relation on the set of Schr\"{o}der paths. We create a set of rules inspired by tilings that define a relation represented as a directed graph. Through implementation of these rules using Python, we can explore properties of digraphs on Schr\"{o}der paths.
